                <h1>About Me</h1> 
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>As a young and aspiring individual such as myself, I look forward to the next "best thing."
                    Eager, driven, motivated, fast-learner; just some of the words I would use to describe myself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Although I have only been doing web development for a short period of time. I realize that my passion
                    for web development is well established.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have enjoyed working with my collegues and look forward to be part of a team and expand my knowledge 
                    in this field. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The challenges do not frighten me; I welcome them. To me that means the reward will feel that much
                    more meaningful when I accomplish the task at hand.
